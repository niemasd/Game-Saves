To determine the correct button remaps you need, you can look at:
    "Game Controllers"->your controller->"properties"; and bash buttons until you know your current button IDs.
    Alternatively, you could look up controller test software that does the same.
After you found your controller's button mapping, you can fill them in accordingly, in the above list.
Leave left and right trigger at 13 and 14 to keep them working as controller axes 9 and 10
